These are some reference GameBuilder builds.

gamebuilder-ARCHIVE-*.7z
  Archival build (last version published to Steam).
  This build corresponds to the last version released to
  Steam. It has most plugins enabled, for example 2D UI,
  rich JS editor, etc, (but not multiplayer)..

gamebuilder-OSS-*.7z
  Reference build for Open Source version.
  This is the build that you get when you check out
  and compile the open-source codebase as-is, without
  enabling any extra plugins.
